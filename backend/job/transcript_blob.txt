 Yo! What a G. Hey, I didn't forget. What? Have you heard of me? I know. Whoa! You ready to get lit tonight? Ah, I think I'm gonna go out with my girl tonight. Girl. Who's your girl? Remember Monica? A couple of days ago? The chick at the bar that was making you buy her drinks. She was talking to every dude in the club that night. It's not like that anymore, bro. She's a different person, okay? Uh-huh. Hey, baby. Can I buy you a car for a minute? Why don't you just use your car? Because you have to be on W. Oh, okay, okay, got it. Hey, of course. All right, I love you. She's so cute. Bro, are you serious? What? She's clearly using you. Bro, you can't judge someone you haven't met. Hey, beautiful. Hey, what's the pin to your credit card? It's 4251. Thank you. You just gave me the pin to your credit card? Is it a light that broke? What is it like? What is it like? She's clearly using your card to buy stuff. I get it. Get what? Your jealous. Tell us. Hey, I'm looking for you. I'm trying to watch it. It's okay to be jealous. Look, I'm not jealous, bro. I'm not for years. You met her four days ago. I'm just trying to look out for you. Ha! Hey, babe. What are you doing? Can I come over and hang out with you? You're about to meet her. Hongka? All right. Babe. This is my friend Adam. Hey. You hungry, huh? Kissing. Thank you. So I was just telling Adam what an amazing. Did you not see that? She didn't even acknowledge me. And you said, oh, it's your birthday. She didn't even say anything about your birthday. She didn't say anything about anything. But she's not usually like this. Trust me, it's not like that, bro. Listen to me, bro. Listen. She took your car. She took your credit card. She ate all your food. What is she going to take next? Your house keys? Hey, babe. Hey, where are your house keys? Leave. Hello. I'll walk out that door right now. You'll never see me again. But just trust me on this. You're right. Thank you. What is he I should do? Next time you see her, you're going to look at her face. And you're going to say, I'm done. It's over. We're breaking up. We're breaking up. Let me hear you say, hey Monica, we're done. Like that? No. I need it from here. More aggressive. Yeah. Hey Monica, we're done. More shoulder blades. Flex them. Yeah. Yeah. Hey Monica. We're done. Hey Monica. We're done. Hey Monica. We're done. Surprise. Hi. Hi. Surprise. What did you say? Oh. Don't tell me what you said. Tell me what you were saying. I said we're done. Why? I know you're, I know you're using me. What are you talking about? Why'd you take my car? I took your car keys so I can make sure that you wouldn't leave for this price. What about the car? I should've asked for your pin. Yeah. What about my credit card? Why'd you ask for my pin, huh? Remember you told me your pin was your lucky number. I had t-shirts made for us. I thought you would love them. What about the food? What about the food? What about the food? Babe? I ate all your food to make sure you weren't full. I made your favorite sandwich. Why'd you ask for the house keys, babe? I wanted to make sure you didn't lock the door. It's not like that. Get out of my house. But it's not even like that. Get out of my house. Now. I'm so sorry. This is all new to me. You know, and I just... I don't know what I'm doing. But at the end of the day, I love you, okay? Just please forgive me. I forgive you. Oh, I have another surprise. You're going to love it. Does people close, babe? I love your surprise, this. Is that a new TV? Thank you.
